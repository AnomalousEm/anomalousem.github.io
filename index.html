            <h1> Hi, I'm Emily! &#1F44B </h1>

            <p>I'm a cybersecurity professional who’s passionate about protecting organizations from today’s constantly evolving threats. I’ve been working in security operations for over six years, focusing on areas like security architecture, engineering, and operations. Right now, I’m a Threat Detection Engineer at Humana, where I help keep critical systems and data secure.</p>
                
            <p>I’ve gained valuable experience working in highly regulated industries like energy, healthcare, and insurance. These environments have taught me how to tackle complex compliance requirements while building strong security strategies. I’ve also had the opportunity to lead teams and drive projects that improve security posture and deliver real results. One of my strengths is taking complex technical ideas and breaking them down into clear, actionable insights that connect with both technical teams and business leaders.</p>
            
            <p>When I’m not working, I stay active in the cybersecurity community. I’m the Director of Communications for ISSA Kentuckiana, where I help organize events, monthly meetings, and opportunities for local professionals to connect and learn. I also manage the organization’s social media platforms, creating content to engage the community and raise awareness about our events and initiatives. On top of that, I enjoy attending conferences, training sessions, and workshops to stay up-to-date on the latest trends in the field.</p>
